# AdGuard-Home-Whitelist

## Intro

This is a personal whitelist for AdGuard Home that are not included in the standard lists I use.

ℹ Please learn [AdGuard Home's interface](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki) before using this list.

## Aspects

### What's Whitelisted

Domains I thrust and are not included by other lists I use.. [see whitelist as RAW](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aphantylat/AdGuard-Home-Whitelist/main/whitelist.txt)

### What's __Not__ Whitelisted

Probably more than 99.99% on the internet.

🖊 Take the above into account and that fact I live in the Netherlands. The whitelist reflects those facts.

👀 Check the whitelist first to see if it suits your needs.

## Updates

I will update this repo infrequently and sporadically.
