# AdGuard-Home-Whitelist ✅

## Intro

This is a personal whitelist for AdGuard Home. The domains included are the one's I own or thrust.

ℹ Please learn [AdGuard Home's interface](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki) before using this list.

## Aspects ⏺

### What's Whitelisted ✔

Domains I thrust because I own them or I know the owner and more.. [see whitelist as RAW](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aphantylat/AdGuard-Home-Whitelist/main/whitelist.txt)

### What's __Not__ Whitelisted 🛑

Probably more than 99.99% more than you thrust.

🖊 Take the above into account and that fact I live in the Netherlands. The whitelist reflects those facts.

👀 Check the whitelist first to see if it suits your needs.

## Updates 👩‍💻

I will update this repo infrequently and sporadically.
